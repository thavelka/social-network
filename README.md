This is a simple social network ripoff that I'm working on while learning rails. 
Shouts out to Team Treehouse for the excellent tutorials.

I really don't plan on taking down Twitter with this web app, so I'll move on to something new once I'm comfortable with rails.

**Current accomplishments:**
* Successfully installed rails and created a working project
* Used Rails' scaffold generator to create a database, controllers, and views
* Created a git repository and pushed to GitHub
* Learned to make commits, pushes, and pulls
* Cloned repository to a web server at Nitrous
* Implemented Twitter's Bootstrap into my project

**What's next:**
* Get better grasp on the Ruby language
* Learn about helpers
* Learn about CSS and Javascript, learn to implement
* Learn more about database management
* Learn how to create accounts, mailers, permissions
